DeepScan: A Federated AI Model for Lung Disease and Nodule Detection

🧠 **DeepScan** is an AI-driven project designed to detect lung diseases and nodules using a hybrid deep learning approach combined with Federated Learning. This ensures patient data privacy while maintaining high model accuracy across distributed medical datasets.

## 🚀 Features
- Federated Learning approach for secure, decentralized training
- Hybrid architecture combining CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
- Trained on medical imaging datasets (X-rays, CT scans)
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Implemented in Python using PyTorch and Google Colab

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/` - Sample medical images used for training/testing
- `model/` - AI model architecture (CNN + ViT hybrid)
- `notebooks/` - Google Colab notebooks for training and evaluation
- `results/` - Evaluation results, confusion matrix, and plots

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Federated Learning concepts

## 📊 Results
